# Java Data Visualization Library- JC Chart

A standard style for README files

Your README file is normally the first entry point to your code. It should tell people why they should use your module, how they can install it, and how they can use it. Standardizing how you write your README makes creating and maintaining your READMEs easier. Great documentation takes work!

This repository contains:

1. [The specification](spec.md) for how a standard README should look.
2. A link to [a linter](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme-preset) you can use to keep your README maintained ([work in progress](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/5)).
3. A link to [a generator](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme) you can use to create standard READMEs.
4. [A badge](#badge) to point to this spec.
5. [Examples of standard READMEs](example-readmes/) - such as this file you are reading.

Standard Readme is designed for open source libraries. Although itâ€™s [historically](#background) made for Node and npm projects, it also applies to libraries in other languages and package managers.

## Background
There are many plotting libraries for Python, Javascript, R and Matlab â€“ some examples include 
Plotly and Mathplotlib . However, there are not many for Java. This project involves
developing 2D plotting libraries for use with Java. The idea would be able to 
create images in various formats that could be displayed and used in papers, Web pages etc. 
There are many different kinds of plots that could be created and many different visualization 
styles. The motivation for this would be to enable datasets being 
manipulated using java to visualized without the need to use other toolsets such as Python, R or 
Matlab.

Primary: 
- Data pre-processing
- Provide a method that turns data into a format suitable for plotting.
- Provide methods that return descriptive statistics, both for plotting charts and get 
statistical information, including mode, mean, median, sum, max, min, percentilesï¼Œ
quantile variance, skewness, covariance, etc.
- Chart plotting
- Plot scatter, line, bar, box, column, pie, bubble and heat charts based on the input data
- Export chart in PNG format
- Function plotting
- Support for drawing elementary functions and composition of any of finite number of them, 
including constant functions, power functions, square root functions, exponential
functions, logarithms functions, trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions 
and piecewise functions composed of elementary functions

Secondary:
- Data pre-processing
- Support for trimming, merging, selecting and amending of tables.
- Generate a linear regression curve for input data sets.
- Chart plotting
- Support for changing the style of the chart, including but not limited to coordinate length 
and width, line/column colour, label size, point shape, background colour, font size.
- Support a combination of different charts or function charts.
- Support for drawing a 3-dimensional point-set graph based on the input point-set in 
three dimensions,
- Generate a smooth surface based on a 3-dimensional point set
- Support for controlling the size, colour, texture, transparency, display angle, etc. of the 

- Function plotting
- Plot statistical distribution function
Standard Readme started with the issue originally posed by [@maxogden](https://github.com/maxogden) over at [feross/standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) in [this issue](https://github.com/feross/standard/issues/141), about whether or not a tool to standardize readmes would be useful. A lot of that discussion ended up in [zcei's standard-readme](https://github.com/zcei/standard-readme/issues/1) repository. While working on maintaining the [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) repositories, I needed a way to standardize Readmes across that organization. This specification started as a result of that.

> Your documentation is complete when someone can use your module without ever
having to look at its code. This is very important. This makes it possible for
you to separate your module's documented interface from its internal
implementation (guts). This is good because it means that you are free to
change the module's internals as long as the interface remains the same.

> Remember: the documentation, not the code, defines what a module does.

~ [Ken Williams, Perl Hackers](http://mathforum.org/ken/perl_modules.html#document)

Writing READMEs is way too hard, and keeping them maintained is difficult. By offloading this process - making writing easier, making editing easier, making it clear whether or not an edit is up to spec or not - you can spend less time worrying about whether or not your initial documentation is good, and spend more time writing and using code.

By having a standard, users can spend less time searching for the information they want. They can also build tools to gather search terms from descriptions, to automatically run example code, to check licensing, and so on.

The goals for this repository are:

1. A well defined **specification**. This can be found in the [Spec document](spec.md). It is a constant work in progress; please open issues to discuss changes.
2. **An example README**. This Readme is fully standard-readme compliant, and there are more examples in the `example-readmes` folder.
3. A **linter** that can be used to look at errors in a given Readme. Please refer to the [tracking issue](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/5).
4. A **generator** that can be used to quickly scaffold out new READMEs. See [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme).
5. A **compliant badge** for users. See [the badge](#badge).

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
$ npm install --global standard-readme-spec
```

## Usage

This is only a documentation package. You can print out [spec.md](spec.md) to your console:

```sh
$ standard-readme-spec
# Prints out the standard-readme spec
```

### Generator

To use the generator, look at [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme). There is a global executable to run the generator in that package, aliased as `standard-readme`.

## Badge

If your README is compliant with Standard-Readme and you're on GitHub, it would be great if you could add the badge. This allows people to link back to this Spec, and helps adoption of the README. The badge is **not required**.
